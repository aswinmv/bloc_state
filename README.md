  <h1>Bloc State Management in Flutter</h1>

  <p>Bloc (Business Logic Component) state management is a robust and widely adopted design pattern in Flutter for efficiently managing and organizing application state. In Flutter development, maintaining a clear separation between the user interface and the business logic is crucial for scalability and maintainability. Bloc achieves this separation by introducing distinct components for handling business logic, events, and state. It follows a unidirectional data flow, where events trigger state changes, and the updated state is reflected in the UI. The key components of Bloc include the <code>Bloc</code> itself, responsible for managing the state, and the <code>Event</code> and <code>State</code> classes that define the events triggering state changes and the resulting states, respectively. This pattern promotes reusability, testability, and a clean, structured architecture, making it particularly effective for complex Flutter applications where state management is a critical aspect of development.</p>

## Introduction

This project is a simple demonstration of the BLoC (Business Logic Component) pattern in Flutter. The BLoC pattern is a great way to manage state and separate business logic from UI in a scalable and testable way.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, clone the repository and navigate into the project directory. Then, run the following command to get all the dependencies:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Running the App

To run the app, use the following command:

```bash
flutter run
```

## Features

This project demonstrates the following features:

- Using BLoC for state management
- Separation of business logic from UI
- Scalable and testable code
